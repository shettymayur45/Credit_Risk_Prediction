# Credit_Risk_Prediction
I have modelled an advanced regression model that accurately predicted credit risk with an 82% accuracy rate. I used statistical algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve-Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, leveraging a sizable dataset. Each stage, from careful data cleansing to perceptive visualization, was carried out with great care to guarantee the stability and dependability of the model. This project demonstrated my skills in machine learning and data analysis, as well as my capacity to provide solutions with a significant impact by using a strict process and paying close attention to detail.
